Pebble [announced](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises/posts/1151421) [smartstraps](https://developer.pebble.com/smartstraps/) on March 3rd, 2015, as part of their [record-breaking](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/most-funded) [Pebble Time Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises/description).  

The next major milestone in the smartstrap timeline was the unveiling of the [smartstrap API](https://developer.pebble.com/docs/c/Smartstrap/) at the [Pebble Rocks Boulder hackathon](https://www.hackster.io/hackathons/pebble-rocks-boulder/a-pebble-hackathon/projects) in [Boulder, CO](https://developer.pebble.com/blog/2015/09/11/boulder-hackathon/).  This event resulted in almost two dozen [smartstrap-based projects](https://www.hackster.io/team-hack-dads/pebble-altimeter-smart-strap-aa01b9), as well as a good deal of buzz for the new accessory port, including [coverage by Make:](http://makezine.com/2015/09/25/hacking-on-the-pebble-smartstrap/)!  

It wasn't long before commercial smartstraps started to appear, such as the hackable [Seeed RePhone Strap Kit](https://github.com/ishotjr/rephone-smartstrap/wiki), the gesture-controlled [Deus Ex Aria Wearable](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/belfio/deus-ex-aria-the-evolution-of-smartwatch-control/description), the [TYLT VÜ Pulse](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/800343142/tylt-vu-pulse-for-pebble-timetm/description) heart rate monitor and wireless charger, the (unsuccessfully funded) [Ripple Solar Watch Strap](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170743596/ripple-the-most-advanced-solar-watch-strap-for-peb/description), the [Pagaré NFC Payment Smartstrap](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fitpay/pagare-contactless-payment-smartstraps-for-pebble/description), and the [Pal GPS and Extended Battery Strap](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/655382546/pal-strap-gps-and-extended-battery-strap-for-pebbl/description).  We have backed, beta tested, developed for, or will otherwise be receiving each of these smartstraps; as of publication, the only to have successfully shipped to backers is the [Seeed RePhone Strap Kit for Pebble Time](http://ishotjr.com/seeed-rephone-smartstrap-for-pebble-time-unboxing/), but many of the others should start shipping soon, at which point you can expect in-depth reviews, comparisons, and development insights from us! :bowtie:
